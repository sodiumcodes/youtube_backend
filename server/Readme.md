# 🚀 Quinova — Scalable Social Backend API

A **production-grade backend API** for a modern social/portfolio platform built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.

This project powers a **creator-focused platform** where users can:

* Share posts (images)
* Build public portfolios
* Discover content 
* Engage through likes, saves, comments, and follows
* Organize saved content into collections and add a personal/private note to each post

## 🧠 Design Principles

* **Separation of concerns**
* **Scalable data modeling (no large arrays)**
* **Index-driven queries**
* **Minimal payload responses**
* **Transaction-safe operations**
* **Precomputed counts for performance**

---

# ⚡ Performance Optimizations

## ✅ Indexing Strategy

### Post
* `{ author: -1, isFeatured: -1, createdAt: -1 }`
* `{ author: -1, engagementRate: -1 }`
* `{ tags: 1 }`

### Follow
* `{ follower: 1, following: 1 }` (Unique)

### CollectionItem
* `{ collections: 1, post: 1 }` (Unique)
* Individual indexes on `collections` and `post`

### Comment
* `{ post: 1, parent: 1, createdAt: -1 }`
* Individual indexes on `post` and `parent`

---

## ✅ Pagination

All endpoints support:

```
?page=1&limit=10
```

* Max limit capped (anti-abuse)
* Efficient skip-based pagination

---

## ✅ Count Optimization

Instead of expensive queries:

* `followersCount`
* `likesCount`
* `commentsCount`

👉 Updated at write-time → fast reads
